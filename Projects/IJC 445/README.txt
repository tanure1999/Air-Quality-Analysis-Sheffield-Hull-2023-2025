IJC445 – Data Visualisation 

This document presents the completed work for the IJC445 Data Visualisation module. The project develops a composite visualisation to examine air-quality patterns in Sheffield and Hull, using the same cleaned datasets and analytical workflow as IJC437 while addressing a different set of learning objectives.

The focus of IJC445 is on visual reasoning rather than statistical exploration. A multi-panel composite visualisation integrates seasonal summaries, daily variability, smoothed trends, and pollutant relationships into a single analytical narrative. This approach enables patterns to be interpreted across multiple temporal scales without relying on a single chart type.

The visualisation design is evaluated using the ASSERT framework and the Grammar of Graphics, with explicit justification for data structure, encoding choices, and layout decisions. Particular attention is given to how visual design supports comparison, reduces cognitive load, and guides interpretation.

Accessibility and ethical considerations are central to the analysis. The project examines issues such as overplotting, colour use, aggregation effects, and the risk of misinterpretation when communicating environmental data to non-expert audiences. Design trade-offs are discussed alongside potential improvements, including alternative visual forms and interactive extensions.

Although the underlying data processing and code are shared with IJC437, the IJC445 submission is distinct in purpose and evaluation. It prioritises critical visual analysis, design theory, and reflective discussion over statistical trend detection or modelling.
